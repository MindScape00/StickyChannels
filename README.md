## Credits
Addon created by Varstahl from Curse - All credits go to him!
I merely updated the addon for 7.3.5 (even though it was updated in 2015, it used a function deprecated back in 2013), as well as adding in a 'X' close button at the top, making the frame movable, and adding in a "/reload" hint at the bottom, as that seems to be needed now to make the changes take affect.
